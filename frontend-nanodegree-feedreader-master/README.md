# Project Overview

Using Jasmine, I created several test suites to test an existing project that was already provided

## How to run

Open index.html in web browser to view the project and test suite results

## Test suites

1) RSS feeds
  -test to make sure all feeds are defined
  -test to make sure each feed has a URL & that each URL is not empty
  -test to make sure each feed has a name
2) Menu
  -test to make sure the menu is hidden
  -test to make sure the menu appears and disappears with a click
3) Initial entries
  -asynchronous test to make sure each feed has a single entry
4) New Feed Selection
  -test to make sure loaded feeds are not equal to one another
